Google Glass UI Kits for Sketch
===============

This is a UI kit for Google Glass, including 8 templates:
* author
* text
* left image
* full bleed
* column
* list
* alert
* menu

I make this UI kit based on [Metrics and Grids](https://developers.google.com/glass/design/style) and [Google Mirror API Playground](https://developers.google.com/glass/tools-downloads/playground).
